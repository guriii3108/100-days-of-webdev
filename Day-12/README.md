### Day 12 — Portfolio Project

A minimal, responsive one-page portfolio built with semantic HTML and modern CSS. It features a hero section, a projects preview, and a contact area with a simple form—styled as cards on a dark, elegant gradient.

### Preview
- Hero with name and role
- Social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, X)
- Projects gallery (placeholder images)
- Contact details and form
- Footer credit

### Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (flexbox, responsive media queries)

### Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

No build steps or dependencies are required.

### File Structure
```text
Day-12/
├─ index.html   # Markup for the portfolio
├─ style.css    # Styles (layout, components, responsive rules)
└─ README.md    # Project documentation
```

### Customize
- Text: Update copy in `index.html` (name, role, contact info, section headings).
- Links: Replace social URLs in `index.html` (`.social-left` anchors).
- Images: Swap project thumbnails by changing `background-image` URLs in `style.css` under `.project-img.img-*`.
- Colors/Fonts: Tweak the gradient, palette, and typography in `style.css`.

### Accessibility Notes
- Uses sufficient color contrast for text on dark backgrounds.
- Form fields include placeholders and focus styles; add labels/ARIA as needed for production use.
