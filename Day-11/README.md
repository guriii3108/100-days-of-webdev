ðŸ“’ [Notion Notes](*https://www.notion.so/Day-11-Debugging-Polish-Best-Practices-282f1e5ce88680adba12c51fda2bb9c5?source=copy_link*)
Today marks the completion of my **CSS module** in the #100DaysOfWebDevelopment journey ðŸš€. I spent the day polishing my skills by learning how to debug, clean, and optimize my CSS â€” making sure every line of code adds value to the layout.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Used **DevTools** effectively for inspecting and debugging layout issues.
- Understood and applied **CSS Resets** and **normalize.css** to ensure cross-browser consistency.
- Followed the **BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)** naming convention for cleaner, modular CSS.
- Practiced combining **selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements** to add finishing touches and interactions.
- Improved my **responsive design debugging** and layout alignment using visual tools.

## âœ… CSS Journey Recap
Over the past 7 days, I covered:
- CSS Fundamentals (selectors, box model, units, typography)  
- Flexbox & Grid Layouts  
- Animations, Transitions, and Pseudo-elements  
- Responsive Design & CSS Variables  
- Debugging and Best Practices  

This wraps up my **CSS foundation phase** ðŸŽ‰ and Iâ€™m super proud of how much Iâ€™ve grown in just a week!

## ðŸ”œ Next Step (Days 12â€“15)
From **Day 12 to Day 15**, Iâ€™ll be:
- Building multiple **HTML + CSS combined projects**
- Focusing on layouts, landing pages, and mini portfolios  
- Strengthening my fundamentals before stepping into **JavaScript**
