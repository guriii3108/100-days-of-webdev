# 📅 Day 01 – HTML Basics  

## ✅ What I Learned  
- Structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)  
- Headings (`<h1>` – `<h6>`)  
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)  
- Links (`<a>`)  
- Images (`<img>`)  

## 💻 Project  
Built my first **simple webpage** introducing myself using headings, paragraphs, links, and an image.  

👉 [View Code](./index.html)  

## 📝 Notes  
- HTML is not case-sensitive but writing in lowercase is a standard convention.  
- Every HTML page must start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.  
- Images need `alt` text for accessibility.
