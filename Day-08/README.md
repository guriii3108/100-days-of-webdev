Today’s focus was on mastering **CSS Grid** and creating **responsive layouts**.  
I also worked on a **mini-project** to apply grid-based design in practice.

- `style.css` → Grid + responsive styling

## 💡 Key Learnings
- CSS Grid is extremely powerful for **two-dimensional layouts** (rows + columns).  
- Flexbox works great for **one-dimensional alignment**, but Grid makes **overall layout structure easier**.  
- Combining Grid + Flexbox = best of both worlds for modern responsive design.
