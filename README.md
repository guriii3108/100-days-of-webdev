This repository contains my #100DaysOfWebDev journey.
Each day I learn new concepts in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and backend basics,
and build mini-projects to practice.

Folders are organized by day: Day01, Day02, â€¦, Day100.

The goal: Build a strong portfolio, showcase progress, and share learnings publicly.
