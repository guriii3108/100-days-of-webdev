# 🚀 100 Days of Web Development  

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfWebDev** journey!  
This repository contains my daily progress, code, and notes as I learn and build projects in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and backend**.  

---

## 📅 Structure  

- **Day-wise folders** → Each folder (`Day-01`, `Day-02`, etc.) contains the code for that day’s task/project.  
- **Notes** → Linked in each day’s folder or in my Notion space (if applicable).  

---

## 🎯 Goals  

- Strengthen my fundamentals in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- Learn **React** and dive into **backend**  
- Build **mini-projects** daily and at least **1 capstone project** by the end  
- Share progress **daily on GitHub** and **weekly on LinkedIn**
