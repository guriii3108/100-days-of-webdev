Day 24 — Async/Await Mini Project

Overview
Today I built a tiny project to practice modern JavaScript async patterns using `async`/`await`. The app fetches a random quote from an open API and displays it on the page.

How to Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Click the “Get New Quote” button to fetch a fresh quote.

What I Practiced
- Writing `async` functions and using `await` for readability
- Handling errors with `try/catch` and basic UI fallbacks
- Simple DOM updates during async operations (loading state → result/error)

Future Improvements
- Add minimal styles and loading skeletons
- Cache the last few quotes for offline viewing
- Add keyboard shortcut (e.g., press `n` for next quote)
